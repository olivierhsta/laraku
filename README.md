# laraku

Lara[vel for Sudo]ku is a web application for Sudoku.  The goal for it is to be able to feed it an unsolved but solvable sudoku grid and have it solve the puzzle in a human-like way and return every steps to the solution.  I would also like it to include everything related to sudoku (tutorials, grid generator, maybe a blog, etc.).

Right now, the solver can use these techniques (These are taken from the book "Mensa Guide to Solving Sudoku" of Peter Gordon):
- [x] One choice
- [x] Elimination
- [x] Naked subsets
- [ ] Subsets (not naked)
- [ ] Interaction
- [ ] Candidate-free solving
- [ ] X-Wing
- [ ] XY-Wing
- [ ] XYZ-Wing
- [ ] Gordonian logic
- [ ] (Forcing chains)
- [ ] (Grid coloring)
- [ ] (Bilocation)
- [ ] (Bivalue graphs)
